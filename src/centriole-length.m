##where the histogram has a high peak for pixels of white intensity
##and the part of interest is the long tail after the peak.
##
## Our histogram is the other way around (note that on the publication
## they put white on the left though), which is the adaptation that we
## do.

##http://forum.imagej.net/t/understanding-imagej-implementation-of-the-triangle-algorithm-for-threshold/752/7

##
## FIXME this does not return the same threshold values as ImageJ.
